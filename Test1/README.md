# FIZZBUZZ
## Question 
Write a simple FizzBuzz function, which should output a sequence of integers from 1 to 100 that returns “Fizz” for multiples of 3,  “Buzz” for multiples of 5, and “FizzBuzz” for multiples of both 3 and 5. This should result in something like 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz….

## Solution
The requirements are these:

* Given a list of numbers from 1 to 100.
* If a number is divisible by 3 function should return Fizz.
* If a number is divisible by 5 function should return Buzz.
* If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5 function should return FizzBuzz.
